# hangman
A simple hangman game implemented using React.js

## How to run the project ##
After you clone the repository to your local machine, **in the root directory of this repository**, enter the following command in your terminal:

``` cd hangman ```

Note that after you run this command you should be able to see this directory structure:

If so, then run the following command to start building the game:

``` npm start ```

And you can enjoy the game now! It will let you guess a programming language or a food randomly for each turn. When you are done playing a turn, click "reset" button to start a new attempt!

## Trouble Shooting ##

If running ``` npm start ``` results in "react-scripts: command not found" error, try the following commands to fix:

``` npm install react-scripts ```

``` git rm package-lock.json ```
